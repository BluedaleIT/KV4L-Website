                <h3>About Klang Valley</h3>

                <p>
                  Klang Valley is an urban melange in Malaysia, based in Kuala Lumpur, and encompasses its neighbouring
                  cities and towns in the state of Selangor. It is bound to Greater Kuala Lumpur, although there are
                  differences between the two.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Klang Valley is physically delineated by the Titiwangsa Mountains to the north and the east and
                  the Straits of Malacca to the west. It stretches to Rawang in the northwest, to Semenyih in the
                  southeast, and to Klang and Port Klang in the southwest. The conurbation is the centre of Malaysia's
                  industry and trade.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The valley is named after the Klang River, the main river that passes through it, which begins at the
                  Klang Gates Quartz Ridge in Gombak and passes into the Malacca Straits in Port Klang. The river is
                  closely related to the early development of the region as a network of tin mining towns at the end of
                  the 19th century. The growth of the region took place mainly in the East-West direction (between
                  Gombak and Port Klang) but the urban areas surrounding Kuala Lumpur have since expanded north and
                  south towards the Perak and Negeri Sembilan borders.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Klang Valley is the densest region within Peninsular Malaysia. With close to 8 million people, it is
                  an urban agglomeration. Although the Klang Valley technically comprises of different cities and
                  suburbs, integration between these cities is very high, with a highly developed road network and an
                  enhanced integrated rail transit system. Many expressways cross the metropolis, making cars the most
                  convenient way to get around.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, this has contributed to the Klang Valley's infamous traffic jams, which stretch several
                  kilometres of highways and make driving exhausting during peak hours. To curb this, the government has
                  implemented The Klang Valley integrated system which comprises of the KTM, LRT and MRT and monorail.
                  The system is currently being upgraded to include a new MRT line and LRT line as well as a monorail
                  serving Putrajaya.

                The Klang Valley Integrated Transit System currently consists of three light rapid transit (LRT) lines, two commuter rail lines, one monorail line, one bus rapid transit line, and three airport rail links. The LRT lines connect the city centre with major suburbs around the city. The monorails serve various locations in the city centre. Several interchanging stations integrate these rail services.

                  <p>
                    The climate in KL is quite humid all year-round. Anyone travelling to KL must always be ready for
                    rains at any time of the year. Regardless, the best time to visit KL is from May-July or
                    December-February.
                  </p>
                  <p>The weather can be pretty hot between March - April. Due to the forest fires from Sumatera which
                    typically happens between June - August, the dust particles may cast a haze over KL thus making it
                    not
                    an ideal time to visit the city.</p>

                  <p>
                    Exchanging money in Malaysia is relatively easy as you can find money changers easily. If you want
                    to withdraw money, make sure your home bank ATM card is supported by banks in Malaysia. Also, bear
                    in mind that your home bank can charge an overseas withdrawal fee. You may also realise that the
                    Malaysian ATM adds its own fee. Ask your home bank before you leave what charges will be added-and
                    check the ATM notices to understand any extra charges. Most places in Kuala Lumpur accept
                    debit/credit cards, just be sure to notify your home bank about your trip to avoid your transactions
                    to be barred and your card getting blocked.

                    Passports must be valid for at least 6 months at the time of entry. Visa requirements vary from time
                    to time, so it is best to check with the Malaysian embassy or consulate or the Immigration
                    Department website.

                  <p>
                    Be sure to have your hotel bookings printed. Booking a hotel in Kuala Lumpur is easy, but if you are
                    travelling during peak periods, you may want to book in advance to avoid disappointments. When
                    booking a stay, be sure to check how far it is from the places you want to visit. Check if your
                    hotel provides free Wi-Fi. Most hotels provide free Wi-Fi for their guests. But in case they donâ€™t,
                    you will need to purchase a prepaid phone line with a data plan. Thereâ€™s a myriad of budget to
                    5-star hotels to choose from in Kuala Lumpur.

                    If you do not plan to switch on your roaming while you are travelling to Kuala Lumpur, fret not as
                    most hotels give you access to their Wi-Fi. Whilst most cafÃ©s in Kuala Lumpur provide free Wi-Fi
                    with the purchase of a drink or food. There are also many free Wi-Fi hotspot areas in Kuala Lumpur
                    so make sure to check out the area for free Wi-Fi. It is also advisable to buy a prepaid SIM card
                    with a data plan to make things easier when you are on the go.

                    The heat and humidity in Kuala Lumpur can be intense. Therefore, be sure to pack light and
                    breathable clothes that will help you stay cool and avoid heatstroke. Cotton is a good choice, as it
                    is designed to absorb moisture. If your hotel comes with a swimming pool or you are planning to head
                    to the beach, donâ€™t forget to pack your swimsuit.

                    automatically hook-up to a local network. Otherwise, prepaid sim cards can be purchased starting at
                    RM20 for registration and talk time. The three main phone providers in Malaysia are Maxis, Celcom
                    and DiGi. Buying prepaid sim cards is easy since you can find kiosks selling prepaid sim cards
                    almost everywhere.

                    Each city has its unique area code for landlines. 03 is Kuala Lumpurâ€™s area code followed by the
                    eight-digit number when you call from your mobile phone. Example: 03-12345678 Whereas, every call to
                    a mobile phone requires a three-digit prefix (Maxis = 012, Celcom = 019, DiGi = 016), followed by
                    the seven-digit or eight-digit subscriber number. Example: 012-123 4567
